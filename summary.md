## üñ•Ô∏è Implementation of React Frontend

To complement the backend system, the **frontend of NeuroDoc** was developed using **React 19**, providing a modern, fast, and user-friendly interface. The interface allows users to search enterprise documents using keyword, semantic, or hybrid methods, while also supporting advanced filters, theme switching, and multilingual support.

The frontend communicates directly with the OpenSearch backend through a custom query structure, and it dynamically updates the UI with search results, query highlights, and contextual metadata.
